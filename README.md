# Facial Keypoint Detection Project

## Introduction

Facial keypoint detection is a crucial task in computer vision, enabling precise analysis of facial features and expressions. This project focuses on training a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to accurately localize 15 key facial landmarks on grayscale images.

## Problem Definition

The primary task is to predict the (x, y) coordinates of 15 specific facial keypoints, including the corners of the eyes, nose, mouth, and eyebrows, given a grayscale facial image. This task is fundamental for applications in emotion analysis and facial expression detection.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate model capable of localizing facial keypoints using deep learning techniques. By leveraging CNNs and Residual Blocks, the objective is to enhance the model's ability to generalize and accurately detect facial keypoints across various images.

## Dataset Overview

- **Size:** The dataset comprises 2140 entries, each with a grayscale image and corresponding (x, y) coordinates for 15 facial keypoints.
- **Facial Keypoints:** There are 15 key facial landmarks labeled across the columns.

## Preliminary Data Processing

Before training the model, preliminary data processing steps are applied, including converting space-separated strings to numpy arrays and reshaping them into 2D arrays (96, 96) to align with the expected image format.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset through visualizations. Grayscale images with annotated facial keypoints are plotted, allowing for the inspection of the distribution and positioning of facial landmarks.

## Methodology

### Data Processing

- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques such as flipping and brightness adjustment are applied to increase dataset size and enhance model generalization.
- **Image Normalization:** Images are normalized for consistent input values, aiding in faster convergence during training.

### Model Architecture

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Efficiently extracts hierarchical features from facial images.
- **Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet):** Inspired by ResNet architecture, uses residual blocks with skip connections to mitigate vanishing gradient problems.

### Training Process

- Backpropagation and Adam optimization are used to minimize the difference between predicted and true facial keypoints.

## Results

- **Accuracy:** Approximately 73.52% on the test set.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 6.72, indicating the average difference between predicted and true facial keypoints.

## Conclusion

The model's accurate identification of facial keypoints can be further leveraged by integrating a secondary deep learning network for emotion recognition. This extension aligns with the broader goal of understanding both spatial characteristics and emotional context conveyed by facial features.
